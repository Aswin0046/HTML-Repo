      <p class="intro">Hello, my name is Aswin and I got into coding because I heard other people talking about how fun it was and I thought I should give it a shot since there are so many resources on the internet to learn coding.  When I started to learn about coding, I quickly figured out it was way more of an artistic endeavor than I first thought.  What interests me the most is using art and logic to build something that is only limited to my own creativity.</p>
